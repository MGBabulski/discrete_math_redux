# Discrete mathematics reduced library

This is a project that aims to encapsulate basic concepts of discrete mathematics and deliver a general framework for further problem solving. The main idea was to find a compromise between optimization and benefits of the modern programming practicies and that's why the solution relies on static polymorphism and high abstraction.
